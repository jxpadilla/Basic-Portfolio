					<p>
					My professional background is in business and business information systems implementations. I have a bachelors degree in accounting and an MBA. During my career I've been an accountant, management accountant, financial analyst, controller, business analyst, customer support engineer, and software consultant at over thirty customer sites. 
					<br>
					Most of my professional experience has been with SAP, a very large software development company for business applications. SAP primarily serves the Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Business Intelligence (BI) markets.
					<br>
					I have been described as a diligent problem solver that is an excellent team player that can also "fly solo". 
					My passion is to empathize with customer needs to deliver meaningful and lasting results. 
					<br>
					On the personal side, I enjoy the outdoors by hiking our local trails and paddling the lakes in my kayak. In addition I like to golf, work out, and tend to my herb garden. I consider myself an accomplished home cook and often create a vegetarian version of many common recipes.
