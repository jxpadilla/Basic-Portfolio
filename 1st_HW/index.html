					<div class="text">
					My background is in business and business computer system implementations. I have a bachelors degree in accounting and an MBA. During my career I've been an accountant, management accountant, controller, financial analyst, customer support consultant, and software consultant at customer sites. 
					<br>
					Most of my professional experience has been with SAP, a very large software development company for business applications primarily in the ERP and business intelligence market. I have been described as a diligent problem solver that is an excellent team player that can also fly solo. 
					<br>
					My passion is to empathize with customer needs to deliver lasting results. On the personal side, I like to work out, tend to my herb garden and am an accomplished home cook, according to my vegan wife ;)
